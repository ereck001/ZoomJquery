# Zoom jQuery Project

This is a simple web project that demonstrates a zoom feature for displaying and magnifying images. The project consists of an HTML file, `index.html`, and a CSS file, `styles.css`. The HTML file contains the structure and functionality of the zoom feature, while the CSS file defines the styles for the elements.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

Upon opening the `index.html` file in a web browser, you will see a zoom container displaying a main image and a set of thumbnail images below it. The zoom feature is triggered when hovering over the main image.

- Hovering over the main image displays a zoom lens, which magnifies the image based on the cursor's position.
- Moving the cursor within the main image updates the position of the zoom lens and the magnified view accordingly.
- Clicking on one of the thumbnail images changes the main image to the selected one.
- When the zoom lens is active, a larger version of the magnified image is displayed in a hidden section below the main image.

## File Structure

The project files are structured as follows:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure and functionality of the zoom feature.
- `styles.css`: This CSS file defines the styles for the elements in the HTML file.
- `images/`: This directory contains the image files used in the project.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- jQuery 3.6.0: This is a JavaScript library used for simplifying HTML document traversing, event handling, and Ajax interactions. The project includes a link to the jQuery library hosted on a CDN.
